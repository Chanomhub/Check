### What is this?
- This is an add-on for checking the correctness of file locations. <br>
  And distinguish which engine the game uses to develop.
- This add-on was developed by CrypticDay using C language.
- It might not be very useful if you use this add-on for non-H games.

### Necessary conditions

-   [Clang](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project)

<br>
  That's all.

There’s no need to fuss over such matters, let's get started. Let's go!
